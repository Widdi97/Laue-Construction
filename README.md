# Laue-Construction
 This script simulates the Laue transmission image for arbitrary lattice geometries while taking spot intensities into account.
 Lattice positioning parameters can be tuned in an interactive plot.
 The main code, which calculates the Laue spots, is ~100 lines of code.

This image was not recorded with a white light source hence the spot intensities don't agree for all spots.

## Usage
 Add the main path to python-path and run the examples.
